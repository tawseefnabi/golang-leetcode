3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Source: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
Example 1:
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
